The efficiency of the electric kettle has been modeled using a multivariate linear regression approach,
with the equation representing the relationship between the efficiency and several dimensionless parameters (Pi terms). The resulting equation is as follows:
Efficiency = 1.7719672962298478 + 8.292963682539621e-15*Pi_2 - 5.5925922313986414e-08Pi_3 - 6.6682062373379875e-15*Pi_4
This model shows that the base efficiency of the kettle is about 1.77, with very small contributions from the Pi terms,
which show that these dimensionless parameters have a relatively minor influence on the overall efficiency.
The positive coefficient for Π2​ suggests a slight increase in efficiency with this parameter, while negative coefficients for Π3​ and Π4​ indicate that efficiency decreases when those parameters are increased.
The very small magnitudes of these coefficients point to a highly refined system where the efficiency is minimally impacted by variations in these dimensionless groups.
